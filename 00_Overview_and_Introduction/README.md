## Key Concepts

### The Justice System Pipeline
The U.S. criminal justice system can be understood as a series of decision points:

1. **Entry** → Law enforcement contact, arrest
2. **Prosecution** → Charging decisions, pretrial processes
3. **Adjudication** → Court proceedings, trials, plea agreements
4. **Sentencing** → Sanctions, alternatives, incarceration decisions
5. **Corrections** → Incarceration, rehabilitation programs
6. **Reentry** → Community supervision, collateral consequences
7. **Support** → Victim services throughout the process

### System Actors
- **Law Enforcement**: Police, sheriffs, federal agents
- **Prosecutors**: District attorneys, U.S. attorneys
- **Defense**: Public defenders, private attorneys
- **Courts**: Judges, magistrates, court staff
- **Corrections**: Prisons, jails, probation/parole officers
- **Support Services**: Victim advocates, social services

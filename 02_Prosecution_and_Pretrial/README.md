## Key Topics

### Charging Decisions
The prosecutor's decision to charge is one of the most consequential in the justice system:
- **Discretionary Power**: Prosecutors have broad discretion in charging decisions
- **Charge Bargaining**: Negotiating charges in exchange for guilty pleas
- **Overcharging**: Filing more serious charges than evidence supports
- **Selective Prosecution**: Concerns about bias and discrimination

### Pretrial Release and Detention
Decisions about pretrial release significantly impact case outcomes:
- **Cash Bail Reform**: Movement away from monetary bail systems
- **Risk Assessment**: Evidence-based tools to predict failure to appear or danger
- **Pretrial Detention**: Constitutional limits on detention without trial
- **Conditions of Release**: Electronic monitoring, drug testing, check-ins

### Progressive Prosecution
Reform-oriented prosecutors implementing new approaches:
- **Declination Policies**: Declining to prosecute certain low-level offenses
- **Diversion Programs**: Alternatives to traditional prosecution
- **Conviction Integrity Units**: Reviewing potential wrongful convictions
- **Community Engagement**: Transparency and accountability to communities

## Key Topics

### Trial Process
Only 2-5% of criminal cases go to trial, but trials are critical:
- **Jury Selection**: Voir dire, challenges for cause, peremptory challenges
- **Opening Statements**: Roadmap of evidence and theory of case
- **Prosecution Case**: Burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt
- **Defense Case**: Right to remain silent, affirmative defenses
- **Closing Arguments**: Summation of evidence and legal arguments
- **Jury Instructions**: Judge's explanation of law
- **Deliberation**: Jury decision-making process
- **Verdict**: Guilty, not guilty, or hung jury

### Evidence and Forensics
Scientific and technical evidence plays increasing role:
- **DNA Evidence**: Powerful but requires proper collection and analysis
- **Digital Forensics**: Electronic devices, social media, blockchain records
- **Firearms Analysis**: Ballistics, toolmarks, gunshot residue
- **Error Rates**: Understanding limitations and reliability
- **Expert Testimony**: Daubert standard for scientific evidence
- **Chain of Custody**: Maintaining evidence integrity

### Plea Bargaining
90%+ of cases resolved through plea agreements:
- **Charge Bargaining**: Reducing charges in exchange for guilty plea
- **Sentence Bargaining**: Agreeing to specific sentence recommendation
- **Fact Bargaining**: Stipulating to certain facts
- **Coercion Concerns**: Pressure to plead guilty to avoid trial penalty
- **Innocence Problem**: Innocent defendants pleading guilty

## Key Issues and Reforms

### Forensic Science Reform
- **Problem**: Many forensic methods lack scientific validation
- **Solutions**:
  - Rigorous error rate studies
  - Blind testing procedures
  - Accreditation requirements
  - Expert witness standards
  - Innocence Project reviews

### Trial Penalty
- **Problem**: Harsh sentences for exercising trial right
- **Solutions**:
  - Sentence caps for plea vs. trial
  - Transparency in plea offers
  - Judicial oversight of plea agreements
  - Right to trial protections

### Jury Representation
- **Problem**: Juries don't reflect community demographics
- **Solutions**:
  - Expanded jury pools
  - Reduced exemptions
  - Compensation improvements
  - Transportation assistance
  - Childcare support

### Speedy Trial
- **Problem**: Court backlogs and delays
- **Solutions**:
  - Resource allocation
  - Case management systems
  - Settlement conferences
  - Dismissal enforcement

## Data and Research

### Key Metrics
- Trial rates by offense type
- Conviction rates (trial vs. plea)
- Jury composition demographics
- Case processing times
- Appeal rates and outcomes
- Exoneration rates
- Forensic error rates
- Expert witness qualifications

### Research Questions
- What factors influence trial outcomes?
- How reliable are forensic methods?
- What is the impact of the trial penalty?
- How do juries make decisions?
- What causes wrongful convictions?

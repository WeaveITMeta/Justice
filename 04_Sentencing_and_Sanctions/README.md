# 04 - Sentencing and Sanctions

## Purpose
This section examines sentencing decisions, sanctions, and alternatives to incarceration, including sentencing guidelines, disparities, and reform efforts to create more proportionate and effective sanctions.

## Contents

### Alternative Sanctions
- **Community-Based**: Probation, community service, restorative justice
- **Electronic Monitoring**: GPS tracking, house arrest, alcohol monitoring
- **Fines, Fees, and Debt**: Financial sanctions and their impacts

### Sentencing Frameworks
- Sentencing guidelines (federal and state)
- Mandatory minimums
- Three strikes laws
- Truth in sentencing
- Determinate vs. indeterminate sentencing

### Sentencing Considerations
- Offense severity
- Criminal history
- Aggravating and mitigating factors
- Victim impact
- Rehabilitation potential

## Key Topics

### Sentencing Guidelines
Structured frameworks for sentencing decisions:
- **Federal Guidelines**: U.S. Sentencing Commission guidelines (advisory since Booker)
- **State Guidelines**: Varying approaches across jurisdictions
- **Departure Authority**: Judicial discretion to deviate from guidelines
- **Mandatory Minimums**: Legislatively required minimum sentences
- **Proportionality**: Ensuring punishment fits the crime

### Alternative Sanctions
Expanding options beyond incarceration:
- **Probation**: Supervised release in community
- **Community Service**: Unpaid work for public benefit
- **Restitution**: Compensation to victims
- **Treatment Programs**: Substance use, mental health
- **Restorative Justice**: Victim-offender dialogue and repair
- **Electronic Monitoring**: Technology-based supervision

### Sentencing Disparities
Addressing unequal treatment:
- **Racial Disparities**: Significant differences by race/ethnicity
- **Gender Disparities**: Different treatment of men and women
- **Socioeconomic Disparities**: Impact of wealth on outcomes
- **Geographic Disparities**: Variation across jurisdictions
- **Offense-Type Disparities**: Crack vs. powder cocaine, etc.

- Outcome tracking and evaluation

### Electronic Monitoring Technology
**Location**: `04_Sentencing_and_Sanctions/Alternative_Sanctions/Electronic_Monitoring/`

Technology-enhanced supervision:
- GPS tracking systems
- Alcohol monitoring (SCRAM)
- Drug testing technology
- Check-in apps and kiosks

- Victim notification systems
- Collection mechanisms
- Compliance monitoring

## Key Issues and Reforms

### Mass Incarceration
- **Problem**: U.S. has highest incarceration rate globally
- **Solutions**:
  - Eliminate mandatory minimums
  - Expand alternative sanctions
  - Reduce sentence lengths
  - Increase earned time credits
  - Retroactive sentence reductions

### Sentencing Disparities
- **Problem**: Significant racial and socioeconomic disparities
- **Solutions**:
  - Implicit bias training
  - Sentencing data transparency
  - Guideline revisions
  - Appellate review
  - Algorithmic fairness audits

### Fines and Fees
- **Problem**: Financial sanctions create poverty traps
- **Solutions**:
  - Ability-to-pay determinations
  - Fee elimination or reduction
  - Community service alternatives
  - Debt forgiveness programs
  - No incarceration for non-payment

### Proportionality
- **Problem**: Sentences often disproportionate to harm
- **Solutions**:
  - Proportionality review
  - Guideline adjustments
  - Judicial discretion restoration
  - Mandatory minimum elimination
  - Sentence caps

## Data and Research

### Key Metrics
- Average sentence lengths by offense
- Incarceration vs. alternative sanction rates
- Sentencing disparities (race, gender, SES)
- Guideline compliance rates
- Departure rates and reasons
- Recidivism by sanction type
- Restitution collection rates
- Fine and fee burdens

### Research Questions
- What sentencing approaches reduce recidivism?
- How effective are alternative sanctions?
- What causes sentencing disparities?
- How do guidelines affect outcomes?
- What is the impact of mandatory minimums?

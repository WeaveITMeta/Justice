# AI Legal Hotline System

## Overview

The AI Legal Hotline System is a comprehensive digital platform that provides immediate assistance for personal issues and potential legal concerns through AI-powered voice agents, while maintaining strict neutrality until proper authorities can be confidentially instantiated with case numbers for real situations.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Voice AI Integration Stack**
   - n8n workflow orchestration on GCP
   - Ultravox real-time voice processing
   - OpenAI GPT-4 conversational AI
   - ElevenLabs voice synthesis
   - Twilio telephony infrastructure (999-999-9999)

2. **Intelligence & Data Layer**
   - RAG database with Redis caching
   - Nomic Atlas text embeddings API (Enterprise)
   - Grok 4 API for case law research
   - Rust-based infrastructure for high performance

3. **Legal Case Management**
   - Evidence visualization system
   - Digital records management (LexisNexis-style)
   - Case number generation and tracking
   - Court proceeding simulation framework

4. **Communication & Documentation**
   - Otter.ai-style transcription service
   - Automated email generation to support hotlines
   - Ticket number assignment and tracking
   - Multi-modal evidence presentation

5. **AI/ML Optimization Engine**
   - Perceptron neural networks
   - LLM integration with MCP Tool Calls
   - Route optimization visualization
   - Metadata and source tracking

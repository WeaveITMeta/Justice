## Central Rank Authority (CRA)
Central rank authority is similar to single sign on though it works with permissions, scopes and ranks within a user's data to allow for applications to centralize user data and permissions from multiple OAuth 2.0 sources.

## Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
OSINT is the practice of using public information to gather intelligence. It can be used for a variety of purposes,

Facial recognition is the practice of using algorithms to identify a person based on their facial features. It can be used for a variety of purposes, 

## Biometric Recognition
Biometric recognition is the practice of using algorithms to identify a person based on their biometric features. It can be used for a variety of purposes, 

## Email Verification
Email verification is the practice of requiring a person to provide their email address in order to access a service or product. It can be used for a variety of purposes, 

## Phone Number Verification
Phone number verification is the practice of requiring a person to provide their phone number in order to access a service or product. It can be used for a variety of purposes, 

## Machine Learning
Machine learning is the practice of using algorithms to analyze data and make predictions. It can be used for a variety of purposes, 

## Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is the practice of using algorithms to learn from experience. It can be used for a variety of purposes, 

## Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence is the practice of using algorithms to simulate human intelligence. It can be used for a variety of purposes, 

## Blockchain
Blockchain is a decentralized database that is used to store and verify transactions. It can be used for a variety of purposes, 

A lightweight package for all programming languages that implments a blockchain database that is able to cross reference identity with userdata.

Allows for the notification to any user if their media is being used anywhere else without their knowing approval or consent.

Queues up uses of personal media into a front end library that can be integrated into social media platforms to allow for the notification of any user if their media is being used anywhere.

Integrating Operating System level screen shot metadata to indicate the concerning use of scrapping people's media without their knowing consent or approval.

Preventing scammers, hackers and criminals from extorting people with deep fakes and other framed media.

A listener for your own social media account that notifies you of any concerning activity from other people.

Client-side runtime that monitors change events coming from the blockchain database, where it positions visitors of your social media account (Facebook PHP has this with user ID in console log data). Google how to see who is spying on my Facebook account and you can follow simple instructions to see their user IDs.

This same principle can be applied to events taken at the operating system level and syncronized for a record for interpretation in justice and law enforcement.

The runtime change events are in Node.js or an alternative listener for other languages. Whereas the usecases are based in Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Aritificial Intellgience to safeguard users from malicious attacks, extortion, identity theft and cybercrime.

These open source modules can be packaged and installed as a dependency for any custom stack application and implemented with Developer APIs.

The blockchain is important as it contains a time sensitive Record of Events that contain user data to prove the evidence of a crime or malicious activity, or a point of reference for positive actions taken by a user.

This blockchain is constantly solved by a network of nodes that are run by opt-in users of the platform. Opt-in provides security features to the user and may eventually become common place and a requirement by law.

Applications include, Snapchat, VSCO, X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, and any other application that allows for the sharing of personal media.

This media moderation package is then decentralized and encrypted so media across the Metaverse does not get into the wrong hands by any centralized authority.

The reason behind this is to not burden authority with tedious tasks, rather implement RL based solutions that take a load off of law enforcement and justice.

The blockchain is secure, free and open source.

It can be implemented by any application and enables the protection of user data and privacy with automony and control for the end user.

It does this by the following contraints:

1. Media is encrypted and decentralized
2. Media is stored and federated by relevance
3. Media is auditable by the user that matches the identity of the media

Core Principles:
- Self Governance
- Self Sovereignty
- Self Determination
- Self Control

If a Deepfake is ever made of a person and they use it to extort money from them, or blackmail, frame them, or any other malicious activity, the blockchain can be used to prove the evidence of a crime or malicious activity, or a point of reference for positive actions taken by a user.

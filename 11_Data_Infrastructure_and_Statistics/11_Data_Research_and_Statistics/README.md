## Key Topics

### Major Data Sources

#### Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS)
Primary federal source for justice statistics:
- **Criminal Victimization**: NCVS data on crime victimization
- **Law Enforcement**: Police officers, agencies, use of force
- **Courts**: Case processing, sentencing, conviction rates
- **Corrections**: Prison, jail, probation, parole populations
- **Recidivism**: Rearrest, reconviction, reincarceration rates
- **Special Reports**: In-depth analysis of specific topics

#### FBI Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR)
Crime data from law enforcement agencies:
- **Part I Crimes**: Violent and property crimes
- **Part II Crimes**: Other offenses
- **Arrest Data**: Demographics of arrestees
- **Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted (LEOKA)**
- **Hate Crime Statistics**
- **National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS)**: Detailed incident data

#### National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)
Self-reported victimization data:
- **Methodology**: Household survey of ~240,000 people
- **Coverage**: Crimes reported and not reported to police
- **Details**: Victim characteristics, offender characteristics, consequences
- **Trends**: Long-term victimization trends
- **Dark Figure**: Crimes not captured in police data

### Research Methods

#### Quantitative Research
Statistical analysis of justice data:
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Rates, trends, distributions
- **Inferential Statistics**: Hypothesis testing, regression analysis
- **Experimental Designs**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
- **Quasi-Experimental Designs**: Comparison groups, difference-in-differences
- **Time Series Analysis**: Trend analysis, interrupted time series

#### Qualitative Research
In-depth understanding of justice phenomena:
- **Interviews**: Structured, semi-structured, unstructured
- **Focus Groups**: Group discussions
- **Ethnography**: Immersive observation
- **Case Studies**: Detailed examination of specific cases
- **Document Analysis**: Review of records, reports, policies

#### Mixed Methods
Combining quantitative and qualitative approaches:
- **Sequential Designs**: One method informs the other
- **Concurrent Designs**: Both methods simultaneously
- **Triangulation**: Multiple data sources for validation
- **Complementarity**: Different aspects of same phenomenon

### Key Research Areas

#### Effectiveness Research
What works in justice:
- **Program Evaluation**: Assessing intervention effectiveness
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Economic evaluation
- **Recidivism Studies**: Measuring reoffending
- **Meta-Analysis**: Synthesizing multiple studies
- **Evidence-Based Practices**: Identifying what works

#### Disparities Research
Examining unequal treatment:
- **Racial Disparities**: Differences by race/ethnicity
- **Gender Disparities**: Differences by gender
- **Socioeconomic Disparities**: Impact of poverty
- **Geographic Disparities**: Urban vs. rural, regional differences
- **Intersectionality**: Multiple identities and experiences

#### System Performance
Measuring justice system operations:
- **Case Processing Times**: Speed of justice
- **Caseloads**: Workload of justice professionals
- **Resource Allocation**: Funding and staffing
- **Capacity**: Jail/prison space, court capacity
- **Efficiency**: Cost per case, per incarcerated person

## Justice System Framework Integration

### Technology-Enhanced Data Collection

- Implementation science frameworks
- Fidelity monitoring and evaluation
- Continuous quality improvement
- Outcome measurement

## Key Issues and Reforms

### Data Quality and Availability
- **Problem**: Incomplete, inconsistent, inaccessible data
- **Solutions**:
  - Standardized definitions and reporting
  - Mandatory data collection
  - Open data initiatives
  - Data infrastructure investment
  - Technical assistance for agencies

### Research-Practice Gap
- **Problem**: Research findings not implemented in practice
- **Solutions**:
  - Practitioner-researcher partnerships
  - Implementation science
  - Technical assistance and training
  - Incentives for evidence-based practice
  - Dissemination strategies

### Disparities Documentation
- **Problem**: Insufficient data on disparities
- **Solutions**:
  - Disaggregated data collection
  - Intersectional analysis
  - Qualitative research on lived experiences
  - Community-based participatory research
  - Transparency and public reporting

### Evaluation Capacity
- **Problem**: Limited resources for rigorous evaluation
- **Solutions**:
  - Evaluation funding
  - Evaluation technical assistance
  - Academic partnerships
  - Built-in evaluation requirements
  - Rapid cycle evaluation methods

## Data and Research

### Key Metrics
- Crime rates (per 100,000)
- Victimization rates
- Arrest rates
- Prosecution and conviction rates
- Sentencing patterns
- Incarceration rates

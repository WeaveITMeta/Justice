The TAKE IT DOWN Act is federal law, signed in May 2025, that criminalizes the non-consensual sharing of intimate images (NCII), including AI-generated deepfakes, and requires online platforms to remove them within 48 hours of a victim's request. Enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the act protects victims of image-based abuse by establishing a formal takedown process and holding individuals accountable for knowingly publishing such content. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
What the Act Does 

• Criminalizes NCII: It is now a federal crime to knowingly publish non-consensual intimate images of adults or minors, whether they are authentic photos or deepfakes. [1, 2, 5, 6]  
• Mandates Platform Removal: Covered online platforms must establish clear, accessible procedures for users to request the removal of NCII from their sites within 48 hours. [2, 5]  
• Requires Duplicate Removal: Platforms must also make reasonable efforts to find and remove copies of the requested content. [2, 3, 5]  
• Enforcement: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is responsible for enforcing the law and holding platforms accountable. [1, 2]  

Key Features 

• Includes Deepfakes: The act specifically addresses the use of AI-generated deepfakes, which can be created to look like real people. [1, 7]  
• Protects Good Faith Disclosures: The law shields individuals, such as law enforcement or medical professionals, who disclose NCII for lawful and ethical purposes. [2, 6]  
• Bipartisan Support: The legislation passed with broad support in both the House and Senate and was introduced by Senators Ted Cruz and Amy Klobuchar. [1, 3]  

Why it's Important 

• Empowers Victims: Survivors of non-consensual intimate image sharing now have a federal law to hold wrongdoers accountable and a platform to get images removed. [1, 2, 6]  
• Addresses Tech-Enabled Abuse: It provides legal tools to combat modern forms of sexual abuse that leverage digital technologies and AI. [1, 2]  
• Clarifies Platform Responsibilities: It sets clear guidelines for social media companies and other online platforms regarding their role in removing harmful content. [3, 8, 9]

### Great Idea
**Title**: "[Idea] Add real-time translation to AI Legal Hotline"

**Content**:
```markdown
## Problem Statement
Many victims don't speak English as their primary language, limiting 
access to the AI Legal Hotline.

## Proposed Solution
Integrate real-time translation API to support 20+ languages.

## Benefits
- Increased accessibility
- Better victim support
- Broader reach
- Equity improvement

## Implementation Considerations
- Translation API costs
- Accuracy requirements
- Privacy concerns
- Technical integration

## Alternatives Considered
- Human translators (expensive, limited availability)
- Pre-recorded messages (inflexible)
- Text-only translation (excludes voice)

## Next Steps
Looking for feedback on:
1. Which translation API to use?
2. How to handle legal terminology?
3. Privacy and security considerations?
```

## 🌟 Vision

**Build the justice system we all need** - transparent, accountable, evidence-based, and accessible to everyone.

## 🎯 Mission

Transform criminal justice, victim support, and digital identity protection through:
- **Evidence-Based Reform**: Data-driven policy and practice
- **Victim-Centered Services**: 24/7 AI-powered crisis support
- **Preemptive Protection**: Detect and prevent harm before it escalates
- **Digital Rights**: Protect identity and privacy across all platforms
- **Open Collaboration**: Community-driven innovation and improvement

## 💡 Why This Matters

Every year:
- **Millions** experience crime victimization without adequate support
- **Thousands** suffer identity theft and deepfake exploitation
- **Billions** in economic harm from cybercrime
- **Countless** opportunities missed for early intervention and prevention

**We can do better.** This open-source framework provides the tools, knowledge, and community to transform justice from reactive punishment to proactive protection and support.

## Overview

The Justice System is a comprehensive open-source framework combining cutting-edge technology (AI, blockchain, biometrics) with evidence-based justice system improvements. It's designed for researchers, practitioners, developers, advocates, and anyone passionate about justice reform.
